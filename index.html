				<h2>Project Interest Form</h2>
				<em>Step 1</em>
				<p>
					Filling out the project interest is essential for me to get an initial idea of what kind of services you're looking to have done, goals for you and your business, and other key details to determine whether we'll be a good fit for each other.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="28/02/2014">
				<h2>Discovery</h2>
				<em>Step 2</em>
				<p>
					This step of the process is going to be equally important as step 1 because in this conversation I'll be asking you detailed questions about your business to dive deeper and get a very thorough understanding of your business, customer avatar,
					competition, industry, etc. This will allow me to see the larger picture and understand how I can use my expertise to achieve your ultimate goal of growing your business.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="20/04/2014">
				<h2>Proposal</h2>
				<em>Step 3</em>
				<p>
					From there I will go back after our meeting, draw up a proposal which will outline a few things: <br > 1) Reiterate the problems to solve <br > 2) Outline my solution to these problems <br > 3) Clearly define deliverables, payment terms, and a deliverable timeline  <br > 4) Overview of process, communication, other housekeeping items
					<br > If we both agree to move forward we'll both read, sign, and date the proposal.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="20/05/2014">
				<h2>Project Start</h2>
				<em>Step 4</em>
				<p>
					After the proposal has been dated and signed by both of us, a down payment of 10% has been made, and requested information has been sent over (such as documents, passwords, images, etc), I'll begin on your project.
					The project will emphasize communication and clear expectations. We'll have a weekly check-ins throughout the duration of the project to review progress and keep each other up to date. Each deliverable will need to be approved by you, until then I cannot move on to the next deliverable.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="09/07/2014">
				<h2>Project Completion and Project Launch</h2>
				<em>Step 5</em>
				<p>
					After a site testing and the beta launch has been completed. Pending your approval we'll finish the project with the official launch. Post Project Launch, I'll run through what I like to call <i>Post Project Succecss</i> where I'll review various settings, things to look for based on your goals, resources, etc to ensure success going forward.
					I'll also be sending over a brief questionnaire for testimonial and improvement purposes.
